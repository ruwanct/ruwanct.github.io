Software designer and developer engineer for a decade, with the focus on Java related technologies  and Web (Angular, React) technologies.


Quality is a must, and technical excellence matters.These principles guide my daily work.

Since the beginning of my professional life, I have pushed for the creation of well-designed software as a medium- and long-term investment that can combine human and financial gains by enhancing the developer experience and the organization's market responsiveness.

Working collaboratively with domain experts, event-storming, specification by example, domain-driven design, test-driven development, the SOLID principles, design patterns, OO and functional paradigms, clean, reactive, distributed architectures, and the actor model are some of the tools I like to use to tackle domain complexity, enjoy elegant code writing, and comprehend the non-functional aspects of demanding systems.

My natural desire to impart knowledge can be satisfied through coaching, speaking, and drawing activities, which helps me to advance the skills of IT teams.

I have a vibrant personality, a keen sense of curiosity, and a lifelong passion for sports and travel.I like the saying, "Go together if you want to go far; go alone if you want to go fast.".
